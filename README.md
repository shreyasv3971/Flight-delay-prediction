# Flight-delay-prediction
Flight delay prediction is an important problem in the aviation industry, as delays can result in significant costs to both airlines and passengers. In this study, we explored the use of logistic regression, gradient boosting trees (GBT), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest for predicting flight delays. We analyzed a dataset of flight records that contained information such as flight departure and arrival times, airline, airport, and weather conditions. We preprocessed the data, including feature engineering and imputation of missing values. We then trained logistic regression, GBT, SVM, and random forest models using different combinations of features and hyperparameters. We evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our results showed that random forest achieved the highest accuracy among all the models. Additionally, GBT also performed well in terms of accuracy and F1-score. We also conducted feature importance analysis and found that the departure delay, airline, and airport were the most important features for predicting flight delays. Overall, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of logistic regression, GBT, SVM, and random forest for flight delay prediction and provides insights into the factors that contribute to flight delays.
